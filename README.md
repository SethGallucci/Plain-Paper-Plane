Pilot a paper plane as you nimbly soar through an obstacle course of crates! See how far you can fly before you inevitably crumple!

Plain Paper Plane is a remake of a game that I made as part of a friendly bet, long ago. The purpose of remaking this game was to learn about Python's multiple inheritence, the [Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) pattern, and [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/).
